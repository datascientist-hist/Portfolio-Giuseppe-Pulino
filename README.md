# Data Science Projects
# [Project 4: Bitcoin Price Prediction using LSTM](https://github.com/datascientist-hist/Bitcoin-Price)

**Goal**

In this projects, I'll attempt to predict next day prices based on features of previous day using machine learning & deep learning

**Status**

Work in Progress

# [Project 3: Crimes in Italy Dashboard](https://github.com/datascientist-hist/Crimes-in-Italy-Dashboard) 

**Project done with my colleague  Orazio Pontorno**

The first Dashboard focuses on the distribution of crimes in Italy

# [Project 2: Soccer Results Classification](https://github.com/datascientist-hist/Football-Results-classification) 

**Goal**

*Championship used Serie A Year 2021/2022*

The aim of this project is to try to classify if a game is going to end with a number of goal greater than 2, to carry out this task i will download a dataset where are present a lot of features as number of goal,team names and stats related to matches, are also present the odds provided by bookmaker BET365 that can be converted into probabilities and can be used as referencee point ,but my purpose would be beating those odds.

The strategy that i want to adopt is based on goals scored and goals conceded:

- I will compute the average goals scored and conceded for each team from all the previous matches

- and the average goals scored and conceded for each team from the the last n previous matches (that it can be 1 or 2 and so on..)

I would like to find useful differences between the performance of teams in the last n previous games and the performance in the total games, to classify the target

# [Project 1: Spam email Classification](https://github.com/datascientist-hist/Spam_Messages_Classification)



**Goal**

The aim of this project is to classify emails into spam and ham emails.  
To do this I will use the frequencies method that will count  how many different words there are in a sentence after that I will choose a number of relevant words.[Below I will expalin better the method](https://github.com/datascientist-hist/Spam_Messages_Classification)
